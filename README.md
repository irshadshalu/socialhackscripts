# Social Hack Scripts
SocialHackScripts is just a fun and hobby library with some useful or funny scripts,
		  in the initial commit, LetFriendsChat.js is a script that when run on console of WhatsApp web will make the person1 and person2 chat to each other through you.


		  __LetFriendsChat Usage:__
		  * Change variable values of person1 and person2 to names of two friends in your chat list, whose chats are visible in whatsapp web home.
		  * copy paste the code on console and press enter key.
		  * start by running start1("initial msg"); or start2("initial msg");, respective to person u wanna start with
		  * Sit back and watch your friends talk to each other thinking it's you.

		  PS. I really don't find this useful other than for just having fun, I will not be responsible in any manner if this messes up your friendships :p . if anything goes wrong, refresh page,quick. I advice not to try this with grps. as I had to leave two groups because I spammed :p .
